"""
Observation:
- The p-value tells us whether the difference in time to max OD600 between knock-in and knock-out strains is statistically significant.
- If p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and say the difference is significant.

Example Interpretation:
- If p < 0.05: There is a statistically significant difference in the time it takes knock-out vs knock-in strains to reach their max OD.
- If p > 0.05: No significant difference was found between the two strain types.
